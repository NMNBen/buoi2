    <h1>This is <i>still</i> a motherfucking website. </h1>
    
    <p>And it's more fucking perfect than the last guy's.</p>
    <h2>Seriously, it takes minimal fucking effort to improve this<br> shit.</h2>
    <strong>7 fucking declarations.</strong>
    <p>That's how much CSS it took to turn that <a href="http://motherfuckingwebsite.com/">  grotesque pile of shit </a> into this easy-to-read<br> 
    masterpiece.It's so fucking simple and it <i>still</i> has all the glory of the original perfect-ass<br>
    website: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Shit's <i>still</i> lightweight and loads fast </li>
        <li><i>Still</i> fits on all your shitty screens </li>
        <li><i>Still</i> looks the same in all your shitty browsers </li>
        <li>The motherfucker's <i>still </i> accessible to every asshole that visits your site </li>
        <li>Shit's <i>still</i> legible and gets your fucking point across</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>And guess what, motherfucker: </h3>
    <p>You never knew it, but it's easy to improve readabilit on your site. Here's how.</p>





    <h2 >Let it breathe</h2>
    <p>Look at lines 1 and 2 of some shitty website you're building.Assuming they're not<br>
    married they probably shouldn't be humping. The dafaults are trash --pick a minimum<br>
    line-height: 1.4 for body copy. Headings shou be tighter. If you can't see that...piss off. </p>
    <p>If your text hits the side of the browser, fuck off forever. You ever see a book like that? <br>
    Yes? What a shitty book.</p>



    <h2> A little less contrast </h2>
    <p>Black on white? How often do you see that kind of contrast in real life? Tone it down a bit,<br>
        asshole. I would've even made this site's background a nice #EEEEEE if I wasn't so focused on<br>
        keeping declarations to a lean 7 fucking lines.</p>   



    <h2>Size Matters</h2>
    <p>I know your partner says otherwise, but it's true. Bump that body copy to render close to 16px<br>
        or more. Smaller type works well for print, not the screen.</p>


    <h2>Line-width, motherfucker</h2>
    <p>Looking at an LCD screen is straining enough. Don't make me read a line of text that's 200<br>
        fucking characters long. Keep it to a nice 60–80, and users might actually read more than one<br>
        sentence of your worthless dribble.</p>
    <strong>Yes, this is also fucking satire, you fuck </strong>
    <p>I love what the creator of <a href="https://motherfuckingwebsite.com/">this site's inspiration</a> did. What I'm saying is that it's so, so simple to<br>
        make sites easier to read. Websites are broken by default; they are functional, high-performing,<br>
        and accessible, but they're also fucking ugly. You and all the other web designers on the planet<br>
        need to make them not total shit.</p>
